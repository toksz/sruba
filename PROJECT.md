# ðŸŽ¯ Sruba Project Overview

## About

Sruba is a fork of the [bolt.diy](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy) project, extending its capabilities to create a more comprehensive multi-agent development environment. While maintaining the core principles of bolt.diy, Sruba adds additional features and improvements focused on agent collaboration and development workflow optimization.

## Vision

Sruba aims to revolutionize software development by creating an intelligent multi-agent system that seamlessly collaborates to enhance developer productivity. Our goal is to provide a powerful, yet intuitive development environment where AI agents work together to handle various aspects of software development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Agent Autonomy
- Each agent specializes in specific domains
- Independent decision-making capabilities
- Clear boundaries of responsibility

### 2. Seamless Collaboration
- Efficient inter-agent communication
- Shared context understanding
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

### 3. User-Centric Design
- Intuitive interface
- Transparent agent actions
- Customizable workflows

### 4. Code Quality
- Automated code review
- Consistent style enforcement
- Performance optimization
